## What web hosting is:
• Web hosting is a service that makes your website available on the internet by storing your website files on servers.

## Why hosting matters:
• Without hosting, your website remains only on your computer and is not accessible to others.
• Hosting connects your site to the global network so people can access it via a domain name.

## Types of hosting:
• Shared hosting: Cost-effective, good for beginners and small websites.
• VPS (Virtual Private Server): Better performance and control.
• Dedicated server: Highest performance for large projects or heavy traffic.

## Where to host:
• Popular hosting companies and platforms (e.g., Hostinger, Bluehost, DigitalOcean credits mentioned in the description).
• Choosing a host depends on your needs—budget, traffic, control, and technical skills.

## How to choose:
• Consider reliability, support, scalability, cost, and security when selecting a host.
• For beginners, shared hosting is usually enough; as projects get bigger you may upgrade.
